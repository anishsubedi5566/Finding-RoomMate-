Introduction:

As an international student, it is very difficult to find roommates and an apartment to live in. This application will help many students find a proper roommate, such as someone who attends the same university or someone who shares the same major. This platform will provide the contact information of users(if they allow it) to other users so they can contact each other via the built-in messaging system or call, to find out additional details about the university or apartments nearby. Users can post the roommate request, other users can comment on that post or can chat via messaging and also multiple users can form a group together for chatting. We are developing this platform to avoid the hassle of finding a roommate. Also, this platform will help the students to get inside information about the university from the current student of that particular university to figure out if the university is a good fit for them. 


Motivation:

As most of us from this project team are international students, we have been through the hassle of finding a place to live in, only to end up with an unknown roommate. There are some platforms that students use like Whatsapp groups, but only 250 members can join a group, which makes it unfair for others who also want to join. Facebook is also there but it is not specific and not all the students use Facebook for such a purpose. Yocket is one platform, where you can get in touch with current students of a particular university, but again it just solves one issue. We want to develop a single platform to address all the issues of the students.

Core Features:

1. Landing page
● Users can see the posted request from other users.
● Users can post their request.

The posts on the landing page include useful information from the user such as the date the request was posted, the city the post originated from and the university nearby the apartment. Not only do these posts include the time, date, and university, but there are also living preferences listed on these posts. Some of these living preferences include if there is parking available, if there are pets allowed in the building, if the poster allows sharing, the budget for the apartment, and other various descriptions. All users have the option to make posts and fill out these details and preferences. Under the "Make Post" tab, a user can either choose to make a post to find a room, or find a roommate for their apartment.

2. Search roommate by university
● Users can see the available student as a roommate from the same
university.
● Users can see their profile and can message them.

After a user has signed up, they can click on the “Find” tab and the "Find by University" button to browse posts associated with a university of their choice. There, they can look through details of posts for a specific university to figure out if they are interested in moving in or allowing someone else to live with them. 

3. Search roommate by city
● Users can see the available student as a roommate from the same city.
● Users can see their profile and can message them.

After a user has signed up, they can click on the “Find” tab and the "Find by City" button to browse posts associated with a city of their choice. There, they can look through details of posts for a specific city to figure out if they are interested in living with people who are in the area. 

4. User Profile
● Every user need to create profile page, where they need to fill form, which contains:
A. Username

5. In-built messaging
● Users can chat with other users.
● Multiple users can form a chatting group together.

When users are browsing posts from other users, they have the option to view the entire post with the “Click here to view this whole post!” button. Once the user clicks on this, they can view the individual post while also having the options to send a message to the original poster or posting a comment for other people to see. Users can see previous comments submitted by other users on this page. These individual comments display the username of the comment poster and the date.
