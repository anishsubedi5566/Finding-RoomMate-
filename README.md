Introduction:

As an international student it is very difficult to find roommates and find an apartment to live in. This application will help finding a proper roommate, maybe the person who is in the same university or in the same city, having the same major. This platform will provide contact information of users(if they want to) to other users so they can have conversation via inbuilt messaging system or via call, to know some off the record information about the university. Users can post the roommate request, other users can comment on that post or can chat via messaging and also multiple users can form a group together for chatting.
We are developing this platform to avoid the hassle of finding a roommate. Also, this platform will help the students to get inside information about the university from the current student of that particular university to make the valuable admission decision.


Motivation:

As most of us from this project team are international students, we have been through this mental trauma of finding a place to live in and finding some unknown roommate. There are some platforms that students use like Whatsapp groups, but only 250 members can join a group, which makes it unfair for others who are unable to join. Facebook is also there but it is not specific and not all the students use Facebook for such a purpose. Yocket is one platform, where you can get in touch with current students of a particular university, but again it just solves one issue. We want to develop a single platform to address all the issues of the students.


Core Features:

1. Landing page
● Users can see the posted request from other users.

2. Search roommate by university

3. Search roommate by city
